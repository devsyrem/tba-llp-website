ABOUT US

Headline:
Empowering Financial Independence Through Knowledge

Body Copy:
TBA, LLP was founded on a simple yet powerful belief: an educated investor is an empowered investor.

Our firm was created by Shane McDonald, a lifelong student of markets, purpose, and legacy. After decades observing how financial decisions shape families across generations, Shane recognized the need for a model that prioritizes education first — and advisory second.

Today, TBA, LLP operates as a hybrid educational and wealth strategy firm, offering tools, digital programs, and personalized guidance designed to transform financial uncertainty into clarity.

We don’t sell confusion. We teach comprehension.
We don’t chase hype. We build frameworks.
We don’t promise returns. We deliver understanding — and the confidence that comes with it.

Core Values:

Transparency: Every strategy explained. Every decision understood.

Education: Financial clarity before financial action.

Integrity: Doing what’s right, even when it’s not easy.

Legacy: Building beyond today — for generations to come.

Vision:
To redefine how individuals and families experience wealth — not as a number, but as a tool for impact, freedom, and peace of mind.
